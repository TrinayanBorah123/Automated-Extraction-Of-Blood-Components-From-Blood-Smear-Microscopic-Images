 Project Abstract: The main objective of this project is identification and counting of the number of WBCs and platelet from blood smear microscopic image sample. Basically, we have developed an desktop application using Python where the operator can upload a particular image and get some analysis results as output based on K-means Clustering and Fuzzy C mean clustering.
